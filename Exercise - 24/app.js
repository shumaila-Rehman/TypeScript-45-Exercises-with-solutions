//       More Conditional Tests: You donâ€™t have to limit the number of tests you create to 10. 
//If you want to try more comparisons, write more tests. Have at least one True 
//and one False result for each of the following:
//* Tests for equality and inequality with strings
//* Tests using the lower case function
//* Numerical tests involving equality and inequality, greater than and less than, greater
// than or equal to, and less than or equal to
//* Tests using "and" and "or" operators
//* Test whether an item is in a array
//* Test whether an item is not in a array\
