//       More Conditional Tests: You donâ€™t have to limit the number of tests you create to 10. 
//If you want to try more comparisons, write more tests. Have at least one True 
//and one False result for each of the following:

//* Tests for equality and inequality with strings

//* Tests using the lower case function

//* Numerical tests involving equality and inequality, greater than and less than, greater
// than or equal to, and less than or equal to

//* Tests using "and" and "or" operators

//* Test whether an item is in a array

//* Test whether an item is not in a array\



let x  = "Shumaila Rehman";

//Tests for equality and inequality with strings

// Tests using the lower case function

let lowerCase = "shumaila";

//Numerical tests involving equality and inequality, greater than and less than, greater
// than or equal to, and less than or equal to..
