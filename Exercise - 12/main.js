//                    ============> QUESTION # 12 <===========
// Greetings: Start with the array you used in Exercise 11, but instead of just printing each
//person’s name, print a message to them. The text of each message
//should be the same, but each message should be personalized with the person’s name.
var frndzName = ["Aehmad", "Khalid", "Imrar", "Ali"];
frndzName.forEach(function (f_name) { return console.log("Hello ".concat(f_name, " , how are you ?")); });
