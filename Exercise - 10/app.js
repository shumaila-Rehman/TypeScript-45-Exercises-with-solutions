//comment to each. If you don’t have anything specific to write
//because your programs are too simple at this point, just add your name and the current date
// at the top of each program file. Then write one sentence describing what the program does.
var name1 = "shumaiola"; // my name is shumaila   =====> its a comment
var date = "20/4/2024"; // its a date ====> it is also a comment.
