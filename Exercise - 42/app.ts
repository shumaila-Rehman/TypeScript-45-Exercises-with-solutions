//    Great Magicians: Start with a copy of your program from Exercise 39.
// Write a function called make_great() that modifies the array of magicians by adding
// the phrase the Great to each magicianâ€™s name. Call show_magicians() to
// see that the list has actually been modified.

    magicians.forEach(one => console.log(one));

}

}
let magicians_name = ["Ali", "Umer", "Bilal"];
let great_magicians = make_great(magicians_name);
