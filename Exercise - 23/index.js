//                   =========> QUESTION # 23 <==========
// Conditional Tests: Write a series of conditional tests. Print a statement
//describing each test and your prediction for the results of each test. Your code
//sHould look something like this:
//let car = 'subaru';
//console.log("Is car == 'subaru'? I predict True.")
//console.log(car == 'subaru')
//* Look closely at your results, and make sure you understand why each line evaluates 
//to True or False.
//* Create at least 10 tests. Have at least 5 tests evaluate to True and another
// 5 tests evaluate to False.
var x = 5;
var y = 10;
//  All 5 conditions are true..
console.log("Test 1: x  is equal to 5 ? ");
console.log(x == 5);
console.log("Test 2: y is equal to 10 ?");
console.log(y == 10);
console.log("Test 3: 5 is less than 10 ?");
console.log(x < y);
console.log("Test 4: y is greater than x ?");
console.log(y > x);
console.log("Test 5: x and y is not equal to each other?");
console.log(x != y);
var a = 2;
var b = 5;
//  All conditions are false...
console.log("Test 6: a is greater than b? ");
console.log(a > b);
console.log("Test 7: a is equal to b ?");
console.log(a == b);
console.log("Test 8: b is less than a? ");
console.log(b < a);
console.log("Test 9: a is not equal to 2?");
console.log(a != 2);
console.log("Test 10: b is not equal to 5?");
console.log(b != 5);
